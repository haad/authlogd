.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads and authenticate system log messages. Relay them to syslogd. 
Authlogd requires new syslog-protocol format support on syslogd side.
Authlogd needs 
.Pa openssl
,
.Pa libevent 
libraries to run.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 15n
.It Fl c Ar config_file
Specify config file. This file must be properly signed with private_key.
authlogd uses public_key from 
.Fl P 
option to verify this signature and will exit if this signature is bad.
.It Fl C Ar cert_file
X509 certificate file used for signing auth sd elemenents in syslog messages.
.It Fl d
Dump part of 
.Pa config_file
which must be signed with private_key.
.It Fl P
Private key file used for signing auth sd elements.
.It Fl p
Public key file used for config_file verfification.
.It Fl S
Path to syslog unix socket, which is used for logging.
If no 
.Fl S
arguments are created, the default socket of
.Pa /var/run/log
is used.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
reads its configuration file when it starts and verify digital 
signature stored in it if it finds invalid signature server will exit.
For information on the format of the configuration file,
see
.Xr authlog.xml 5 .
.Pp
.Nm
reads messages from the
.Ux
domain socket
.Pa /var/run/authlog
 .
.Pp
.Nm
creates the file
.Pa /var/run/authlogd.pid ,
and stores its process
id there.
This can be used to kill or reconfigure
.Ss AUTHLOG PROTOCOL NOTES
The message sent to
.Nm
should consist of a single line.
The message is authenticated by adding 
.Dq [authlogID@ authmsg="Authorized" authsg=""]
SD element to the message body. Where 
.Pa authsg
contains digital signature of
.Pa authmsg 
entry .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/authlogd.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/authlog.xml
The configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/authlogd.pid
The process id of current
.Nm .
.It Pa /var/run/authlog
Name of the
.Ux
domain datagram log socket.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command was written by Adam Hamsik as a diploma thesis project.
This code is was written on .Nx 5 but it should be easily portable.
